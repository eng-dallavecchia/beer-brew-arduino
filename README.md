<h1>Arduino for beer management</h1>

<p>This is a simple code that gets the measurements for a liquid flow sensor multiple times every second. An average is then sent through
 MQQT to the cloud. This code works along with an API that processes the measurement into useful data and then stores it in a database.</p>
